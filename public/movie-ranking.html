<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time </h2>

<hr>

<h3> La La Land  </h3>
<p> I think it is one of the most beautiful love stories represented
    in a movie. At the middle of the movie, you create an expectation
    that Mia and Seb are going living an eternal life of love. 
    But out of nowhere, there`s a plot twist and they break up. 
    They are still so good together.
    The direction of the movie is exceptional. The colors represent
    the feelings of the characters, the soundtrack does too. So, to me, 
    everything in this movie is perfect, except the end, which is terrible.  </p>

<h3> Baby driver  </h3>
<p> I love the way the movie is directed. The soundtrack is amazing, 
    the way the music is synchronized with the action is perfect. 
    The plot is very interesting, and the characters are very well 
    developed. The movie is very dynamic, and the end is very surprising. 
    And I love action movies </p>
<h3> Cars  </h3>
<p> They always get my complete attencion. I love animated movies </p>
